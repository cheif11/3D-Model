        <p> To make my model I used a program called 'Blender.' To begin with, I found it hard but after watching a few videos and playing around with it, I got better and started to make my model. I wanted to go for an abstract design so Blender is definitely a good way to do it. To get an inspiration for my Model I googled some abstract 3D objects and used them as a reference. Blender is a very popular program used by millions of people to make 3D objects. Of course, I still have a lot to learn but I think with more practise I can get better.
